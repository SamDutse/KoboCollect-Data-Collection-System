# Integrated Health Data Collection System for Malaria Consortium

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive data collection and monitoring system developed for the Malaria Consortium to support the organization’s mission to combat malaria and other communicable diseases among vulnerable populations. The system, built using KoboToolbox, includes modules for disease surveillance, facility assessment, patient treatment adherence, and health worker feedback, enabling real-time data-informed decision-making.

## Project Features
1. **Disease Surveillance Module**
   - **Objective:** Track malaria and other disease cases for rapid response.
   - **Features:** Records symptoms, demographics, risk factors, and GPS data for hotspot analysis.
   - **Validation and Skip Logic:** Built-in validation and skip logic streamline data entry and improve accuracy.

2. **Health Facility Responsiveness Module**
   - **Objective:** Assess facility readiness and resource availability.
   - **Features:** Collects data on facility resources, staff availability, and patient wait times.
   - **Data Quality:** Drop-down selections for region and facility ensure data consistency.

3. **Patient Treatment Adherence Module**
   - **Objective:** Monitor post-treatment adherence to improve patient outcomes.
   - **Features:** Tracks follow-up appointments, adherence status, and GPS for reinfection monitoring.
   - **Reminders:** Configurable follow-up reminders to support patient engagement.

4. **Health Worker Feedback Module**
   - **Objective:** Collect insights on field challenges, training needs, and protocol effectiveness.
   - **Features:** Includes a rating scale for protocol effectiveness, open feedback fields, and attendance tracking for training sessions.

## How to Use This Solution

### Step 1: Install KoboCollect
1. Download the **KoboCollect** app from the Google Play Store. [KoboCollect on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.koboc.collect.android)

### Step 2: Access the Project Forms
Use the following links to preview each form online or import them into KoboCollect for field use:

1. **Disease Surveillance Module**  
   - [Disease Surveillance Form Link](#)  
   *(Replace `#` with the link to your form in KoboToolbox)*

2. **Health Facility Responsiveness Module**  
   - [Health Facility Responsiveness Form Link](#)  

3. **Patient Treatment Adherence Module**  
   - [Patient Treatment Adherence Form Link](#)

4. **Health Worker Feedback Module**  
   - [Health Worker Feedback Form Link](#)

> **Note:** Ensure each link is accessible and properly configured in KoboToolbox for public or organizational use.

### Step 3: Using the Forms in KoboCollect
1. Open **KoboCollect** and select **Get Blank Form**.
2. Find and select the relevant form from the provided links.
3. Complete the form as prompted, using the GPS feature where applicable to capture location data.
4. Submit the completed form data by selecting **Send Finalized Form** when connected to the internet.

### Setup Instructions for Repository Use
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integrated-health-data-collection.git
   ```
2. **Access form templates:** Download templates from the repository to explore question logic, validation, and skip patterns directly.

## Impact
This solution empowers Malaria Consortium with real-time data to improve patient care, support health worker training, and make informed decisions on resource allocation and health policy adjustments.
